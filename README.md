# PYU2016
Protect Your Unit - PHP/MySQL system for online sports wagering game

This project is a PHP/MySQL website I wrote to support a sports pick'em game at VoodooFive.com (now TheDailyStampede.com). Participants can log into the website, select the games they wish to place bets on, and enter amounts.

Our game allows three different types of wagers (point spread, over/under, money line), as well as parlay wagers where you can combine 2 or 3 point spread or over/under wagers. The code can be adapated to other types of sports prediction games.

PYU has been online, and actively used, since 2013. I am overhauling it for the 2016 season to accomplish the following:
- Switch to a W3.CSS framework to improve the site appearance and make it mobile-compatible
- Update PHP from deprecated database features to the current, object-oriented ways of connecting to MySQL databases
- Improve the "Parlay" feature, which has never worked right (this will involve changes to the database backend)
- Learn how to create and manage a project in GIT, which this would be my first time doing
